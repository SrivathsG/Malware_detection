Insightful EDA performed on Open source platforms.<br>
<h4>I conducted a comparative analysis of security bugs in four prominent open-source data processing systems:</h4> ->Spark <br> ->Hadoop<br> ->Mesos <br> ->Cassandra.<br><br> I collected and examined bug reports from their official issue trackers, based on the titles of their descriptions. I classified the bug reports into security and non-security categories. I also extracted various features from the bug reports, such as <b>severity, status, and distribution</b><br><br>.
You can run the "<b>Malware_det.ipynb</b> file to understand the methods used to capture the insights of all the softwares.
